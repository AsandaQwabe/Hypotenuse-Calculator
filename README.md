# 🌟 Hypotenuse Calculator 🧮

Welcome to the Hypotenuse Calculator!
This little app is to quickly calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean Theorem:

a² + b² = c²

So grab your side lengths, and let’s find that hypotenuse in no time! 🚀


## ✨ Features

- Easy-to-use GUI: Powered by JOptionPane, no complicated commands required!
- Error Handling: If you accidentally enter something weird—it’ll remind you to stick to numbers.
- Simple yet Functional: Perfect anyone curious about triangles!


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone project
2. Open the folder "Hypotenuse Calculator" on your visual studio code
3. Run the app by clicking "run app" or pressing the ▶️ button



## 🧠 Example
Imagine a triangle with:

- Side A: 3
- Side B: 4
The app will calculate:
Hypotenuse: 5.0
